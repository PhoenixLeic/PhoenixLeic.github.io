At Phoenix we are committed to protecting your personal information and being transparent about what we do with it.
Our Privacy Policy explains how we use any personal information we collect about you.

<h3><u>The Idle Index Privacy Policy</u></h3>
<p>The Idle Index extension collects data locally, to determine when a user has been idle and the screensaver should start. This data resets each time the screensaver is triggered or an action is taken.
</p>
<p>
We don't collect any data about how the extension is used.
</p>
<p>
This extension uses the Idle and Storage permissions API.
</p>
<p>
We use the storage permissions to store the user screensaver and timing preference.
</p>
<p>
The Idle Index uses Chrome (Chromuim) or WebExtensions Storage Sync API for storing user's settings and browser's Web Storage API (localStorage) for storing user's screensaver preferences.
</p><p>
This data is all collected locally and Phoenix do not collect or store your data.
