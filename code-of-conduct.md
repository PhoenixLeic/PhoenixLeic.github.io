## FTP+screen_share Code of Conduct 1/4/21

**FTP, screen_share events code of conduct tl;dr:**
Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can't resolve an issue, contact staff. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you'll be asked to leave.
Based on previous excellent work by others, this is a living code of conduct. This code of conduct applies to all FTP and screen_share spaces both online and off, including our events, Discord channel, and Zoom/Jitsi calls.

FTP and screen_share are open events for people from many different backgrounds. We expect all attendees to help make our events enjoyable for everyone, regardless of age, gender, sexuality, religious or ethnic identity, or ability.

### All attendees
Please show respect for all attendees. In particular:

* Offensive behaviour such as verbal abuse, intimidation, or harassment will not be tolerated.
* Remember that all our attendees are here for similar reasons, and do not make assumptions about anyone's interests, skill level, or profession based on their appearance or background.
* Remember that "no means no". If someone asks you to stop speaking about a particular subject, or to leave them alone, please do so.
* Support your friends and colleagues. If you see someone behaving badly, please let them know that you're not OK with it.

### Whilst presenting work/ideas
Please ensure that your presentation does not stigmatise, alienate, or marginalise any individual or group. In particular:

* Anything beyond the occasional mild swear word is not appropriate.
* While criticism of artistic practices and methodologies, etc, is OK, please try to offer constructive improvements or alternatives as part of your talk.
* Personal criticism and ad hominem attacks are never OK.

### Apologize for Mistakes
Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them, and avoiding repeating them in the future.

### Consequences
If the organizers determine that an event participant is behaving disrespectfully, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the event without warning or refund.

As organisers, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can't foresee every situation however, and thus if in the organisers' judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.

### Please contact us
To discuss any incidents or behaviour in violation of this code of conduct, please contact Mateus, either in person at a live event, privately messaging during an online event or by email at mateus.domingos@phoenix.org.uk. We will take any complaints seriously, and respond appropriately. Attendees, speakers, or exhibitors who violate this Code of Conduct may be asked to remedy their behaviour, apologise, leave the event, or may be banned from future events.

If you're unsure whether your presentation will be enjoyed by all, please check with the organisers: mateus.domingos@phoenix.org.uk
