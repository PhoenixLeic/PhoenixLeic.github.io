The Idle Index is an online project offering free screensavers created by artists, animators and filmmakers based in, or with links to, Leicester. The most recent set of screensavers was commissioned by Phoenix for Leicester Art Week 2020, following on from the editions in 2018, 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have created an open source version of this extension which can be used by artists and screensaver makers to publish their own screensavers. 
      </p>
      <p>The github repository for this is located here. (link coming soon)

 <h3>About us</h3>

      <p>
      Our art programme explores the creative and cultural impact of new media and technologies, offering new ways of looking at our rapidly changing world.
</p>
<p>
Our programme can also be interactive and playful, offering our audience opportunities to take part and co-create through technology.
</p>
<p>

Over the past eight years weâ€™ve worked with a mix of exciting new artists and leading international figures, including Julian Oliver, Semiconductor and Anab Jain.
</p>
<p>

Through our Interact Labs studio, we also provide a space for artists to learn about digital practices and develop new artwork.
</p>
<p>
Our work with children, young people and families includes a packed programme of workshops, courses and festivals that introduce young people to the world of digital creativity.
</p>
<p>
Taking place in our gallery, across the public spaces at Phoenix and in communities across Leicester, our art programme is supported by Arts Council England and De Montfort University.
