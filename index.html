      Our art programme explores the creative and cultural impact of new media and technologies, offering new ways of looking at our rapidly changing world.
</p>

Our programme can also be interactive and playful, offering our audience opportunities to take part and co-create through technology.

Over the past eight years weâ€™ve worked with a mix of exciting new artists and leading international figures, including Julian Oliver, Semiconductor and Anab Jain.

Through our Interact Labs studio, we also provide a space for artists to learn about digital practices and develop new artwork.

Our work with children, young people and families includes a packed programme of workshops, courses and festivals that introduce young people to the world of digital creativity.
