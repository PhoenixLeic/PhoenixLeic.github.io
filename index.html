The Idle Index is an online project offering free screensavers created by artists, animators and filmmakers based in, or with links to, Leicester. The most recent set of screensavers was commissioned by Phoenix for Leicester Art Week 2020, following on from the editions in 2018, 2019. This can be downloaded <a href="https://www.phoenix.org.uk/event/the-idle-index/">here.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
We recognise there is a wider interest in the use of screensavers as a space for creative artistic expression and investigation. <a href="">The Idle Index Template</a> repository can be accessed here includes a template version that you can populate and publish with your own artist screensavers.
